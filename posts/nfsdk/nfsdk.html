        <h1 style="margin-top: 5%;">Bypassing Driver Security With Race Conditions</h1>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
            <a href="https://netfiltersdk.com/">NetFilterSDK</a> is a software development kit (SDK) that enables developers to use a kernel-mode driver and
            user-mode API (library) to interact with network devices/events on a host device. It is sold to companies as a tool that
            can be embedded within their own programs and as such, the SDK seems to be moderately widely deployed in a number of environments.
        </p>
        <p>
            The instance of NetFilterSDK reviewed in this post is a vendor's <i>Windows</i> version because of two main reasons:
            <ul>
                <li><span>I only have experience in reversing <i style="font-weight: 700;">Windows</i> drivers, not those for MacOS/Linux, and...</span></li>
                <li><span>This vulnerability was initially discovered in a third-party vendor's Windows application that uses NetFilterSDK.</span></li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            It's probably also worth noting that the binary name 'NetFilterSDK' was used by
            <a href="https://www.gdatasoftware.com/blog/microsoft-signed-a-malicious-netfilter-rootkit">
                malware that ended up being signed by Microsoft
            </a>, leading to a substantial amount of name-confusion between the virus and legitimate product online.
        </p>
        <center>
            <i style="color: rgba(0,247,254,0.4);">
                The name of the third-party vendor whose application is vulnerable is <b>not</b> disclosed here as, due to a lack of communication,
                the vulnerability remains unpatched - if the situation changes (i.e, the issue is patched, the driver's certificate is revoked,
                or something else), I will look at providing the company's name.

        <h2>Finding an Interesting Driver</h2>
        <p>
            Going all the way back to the initial research phase, I can't entirely remember if I had already developed
            <a href="https://github.com/michaellrowley/PE-Imports">PE-Imports</a> to automate scanning of driver binaries or
            if I just decided that it would be fun to poke at the third-party driver (which later turned out to be a repackaged
            NetFilterSDK driver).
        </p>
        <p>
            Either way, let's take a look at what PE-Imports <i>would</i> have output if it had been used to
            scan the driver in question (reordered listing for readability):

        </div>
        <p>
            There are some imports to suggest that this driver could be interesting and some that would imply that it isn't.</br>
            First of all, we have some references to functions with 'MDL' or references to 'mapping' in the name,
            these imports refer to interactions with a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/using-mdls">'memory descriptor listing'</a>
            where Windows can map physical memory pages to virtual memory buffers - this is a pretty important function as, if misused,
            it is capable of acting as a privilege escalation vector (this is how most instances of such user-to-kernel escalations happen).
        </br></br>
            Being able to load data into arbitrary kernel regions isn't useful if the attacker already needs to be running as an administrator, and given
            the driver's nature (intercepting and possibly even decrypting host machine traffic) there isn't a huge amount of capability that a kernel
            implant could deliver beyond what is already included in the NetFilterSDK driver.
            In order to interact with the driver and intercept traffic, the attacker will need to acquire a handle to the
            <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/introduction-to-device-objects">'device object'</a> - this
            is where the next set of 'good' imports comes in; <span class="code inline-code"><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-iocreatedevice">IoCreateDevice</a></span>
            creates a device object which the user-mode API will later interact with (it should be noted that most drivers use
            the <span class="code inline-code">DeviceCharacteristics</span> argument to pass in <span class="code inline-code" style="color:rgb(255, 120, 0);">FILE_DEVICE_SECURE_OPEN</span>
            to limit security access), <span class="code inline-code"><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-iocreatesymboliclink">IoCreateSymbolicLink</a></span>
            establishes a symbolic link that the user-mode application can use to communicate with the driver (another great sign if we hope to access the driver), and finally
            <span class="code inline-code"><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-iocompleterequest">IofCompleteRequest</a></span> which
            implies that the driver - to some degree - can handle <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/gettingstarted/i-o-request-packets">IRPs</a> (the main
            way that handle-owners can communicate with drivers, often passing buffers that require delicate translation between kernel and user-mode memory).
        </p>
        <p>
            On the not-so-great side, the driver appears to make use of a number of functions that setup/verify/assign security descriptors to events/objects,
            possibly meaning that any access to the driver could be subject to a security routine.
        </p>

        <h2>Reverse Engineering</h2>
        <p>
            This section covers reversing the driver, the environment used was primarily comprised of a
            <a href="https://www.vmware.com/uk/products/workstation-pro.html">VMware</a> Windows 11 instance
            with a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/windbg-overview">WinDbg</a> kernel pipe and
            some other tools. In addition to dynamic analysis programs, I used Ghidra to actually take
            a look into the binary of the '.sys' file and once I'd figured out that the driver was from NetFilterSDK, the API's '.dll' file
            (choosing Ghidra over the <a href="https://cutter.re/">Rizin Cutter</a> project was due to the inherent KMDF support that could be imported through <span class="code inline-code"><a href="https://github.com/0x6d696368/ghidra-data">'gdt'</a></span> files,
            and chosing it over <a href="https://hex-rays.com/ida-pro/">IDA Pro</a> came down to my need to work across multiple devices which a <a href="https://byte.how/posts/collaborative-reverse-engineering/">self-hosted server</a> could support).
        </p>
        <p>
            Whenever any binary image is loaded to be run on Windows, an entrypoint function is called (unless compiled not to export a default entrypoint) -
            this can be <span class="code inline-code"><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/learnwin32/winmain--the-application-entry-point">WinMain</a></span>,
            <span class="code inline-code"><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dlls/dllmain">DllMain</a></span>, or in the instance
            of kernel-mode drivers, <span class="code inline-code"><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/driverentry-for-kmdf-drivers">DriverEntry</a></span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="code inline-code">DriverEntry</span> has two parameters: a <span class="code inline-code"><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/ns-wdm-_driver_object">DRIVER_OBJECT</a>*</span>,
            and a <span class="code inline-code"><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/subauth/ns-subauth-unicode_string">UNICODE_STRING</a>*</span>
            with the former referring to the driver whose entrypoint is being called, and the latter containing its 'registry path'.
            When this entrypoint is called in the driver being analysed, two functions are called: one checks the state of some global variables
            and the other function (<span class="code inline-code">FUN_000208e0</span>/<i>'DriverInitFn'</i>) is called with the driver object and
            registry path being passed in through <span class="code inline-code">RCX</span> and <span class="code inline-code">RDX</span>, respectively:

            This segment of code takes the structure at <span class="code inline-code">DRIVER_OBJECT + <span style="color: rgba(0,247,254,1);">0x70</span></span> -- the
            <span class="code inline-code"><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nc-wdm-driver_dispatch">DRIVER_DISPATCH</a></span> list --
            and loads its address to <span class="code inline-code">RDI</span> and then loads the pointer to another function (<span class="code inline-code">FUN_0001813c</span>/<span class="code inline-code">MajorIRPHandler</span>)
            into <span class="code inline-code">RAX</span> before setting <span class="code inline-code">ECX</span> to <span class="code inline-code">0x1C</span>. All of these
            assignments are essentially setting up a call to <span class="code inline-code">STOSQ.REP</span>. The <span class="code inline-code">STOSQ</span> instruction on its
            own can be thought of as your CPU's interpretation of <span class="code inline-code"><a href="https://cplusplus.com/reference/cstring/memcpy/">memcpy</a>(RDI, RAX, sizeof(void*))</span>
            but when the 'REP'-suffixed version is used, it essentially loops the aforementioned operation <span class="code inline-code">ECX</span> times.
        </p>
        <p>
            After getting that far into the assembly, it becomes apparent that the above code loops over the local driver's dispatch table and sets all of the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/irp-major-function-codes">major IRP functions</a>
            to a single handler, <span class="code inline-code">MajorIRPHandler</span>, at <span class="code inline-code">FUN_0001813c</span>. More on that later!
        </br></br>
            In addition, the final two instructions just load a pointer to the function as <span class="code inline-code">FUN_000112e4</span> into
            the member at <span class="code inline-code" style="color: rgba(0,247,254,1);">0x68</span> of the <span class="code inline-code">DRIVER_OBJECT</span> object; thus setting
            the <span class="code inline-code"><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nc-wdm-driver_unload">DRIVER_UNLOAD</a></span>
            dispatch to call <span class="code inline-code">FUN_000112e4</span>.
        </p>
        <hr></br>
        <h3>Device Initialization</h3>
        <p>
            As previously mentioned, in order to interact with this kernel-mode driver via IRPs, we need a handle to an exposed
            device object where a handle can be opened from user-mode - preferably from an unprivileged perspective.
        </br>
            Immediately following the setup of the dispatch functions, <span class="code inline-code">FUN_000112e4</span> is called. This function
            is where the interactivity capability is established by calling <span style="color: rgba(149, 255, 0, 1);" class="code inline-code">IoCreateDevice</span>
            with a semi-hardcoded name (<span class="code inline-code">\Device\CtrlSM<span style="opacity: 0.5;">VARIABLE</span></span>)
            and unfortunately for a would-be attacker, this function is called with the flag <span class="code inline-code" style="color:rgb(255, 120, 0);">FILE_DEVICE_SECURE_OPEN</span> - uh oh!
        </p>
        <p>
            By default, Windows will let any user <i>try</i> to open a handle to any device (there are still a couple of ways that handle creation can be selectively blocked
            by hooking handle creation or by blocking <span class="code inline-code"><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/irp-mj-create">IRP_MJ_CREATE</a></span> but that isn't what this driver does).
            The operating system allows drivers the ability to limit access to its devices using functions like <span class="code inline-code"><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdmsec/nf-wdmsec-wdmlibiocreatedevicesecure">IoCreateDeviceSecure</a></span>
            and the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/controlling-device-namespace-access">FILE_DEVICE_SECURE_OPEN</a> device characteristics
            which essentially mirrors access control restrictions from the driver object to any attempts to access the device from user-mode. This means that we now need to confirm
            that those security descriptor functions aren't appropriately used in the environment that this driver is running (otherwise, interaction with the targeted driver
            is confined to other functions, mostly in the form of system-wide callbacks which are heavily sanitized by the OS).
        </p>
        <p>
            Next up, a symbolic link is created between the device and <span class="code inline-code">\DosDevices\CtrlSM<span style="opacity: 0.5;">VARIABLE</span></span>, pretty standard for
            any driver that wants to handle inter-process communication.
            We drop into <span class="code inline-code">FUN_000138dc</span> which checks the <span class="code inline-code">seclevel</span> member at <span class="code inline-code"><a href="https://www.netfiltersdk.com/help/nfsdk2/nfapi_registry.htm">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\</a><span style="opacity: 0.5;">VARIABLE</span></span>.
            If the <span class="code inline-code">seclevel</span> value isn't set to allow universal access, <i>another</i> function is called.
        </p>

        <script src="https://gist.github.com/michaellrowley/6a42eba6bf6b04a272e7ef6e3cf79d3e.js"></script>
        <p>
            In conclusion, as long as our driver doesn't set the <span class="code inline-code">seclevel</span> registry key to <span class="code inline-code">1</span> or <span class="code inline-code">2</span>,
            opening a handle is cleared from Windows verification processes. In case you were wondering, here's the flow of the <span class="code inline-code">IRP_MJ_CREATE</span> handler, which could have
            been used to reject an unauthorised handle request but simply prevents multiple handles being issued using a spinlock (a.k.a 'fancy kernel mutex'):
        </p>

        <h2>Exploitation</h2>
        <p>
            The end goal for this writeup is gaining a handle, from an unprivileged user-mode application, to the vendor-compiled NetFilterSDK driver.
            From that point, a malicious application would be able to make legitimate API calls that deliver access to raw TCP/UDP streams as well as
            the support degradation of system-wide network encryption without on-system security products batting an eye.
            In the third-party application that I discovered this issue on, an administrative service application launched the driver using
            <span class="code inline-code"><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winsvc/nf-winsvc-createservicea">CreateServiceA</a></span>
            and subsequently <span class="code inline-code"><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winsvc/nf-winsvc-startservicea">StartServiceA</a></span>
            to launch the driver after installing it, I didn't identify any modification of the <span class="code inline-code">seclevel</span> value however there seemed
            to be some form of attempt to prevent unprivileged access through the usage of <span class="code inline-code"><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/securitybaseapi/nf-securitybaseapi-setsecuritydescriptorsacl" style="color:rgb(255, 100, 0);">SetSecurityDescriptorSacl</a></span>,
            <span class="code inline-code"><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/securitybaseapi/nf-securitybaseapi-setsecuritydescriptordacl" style="color:rgb(255, 100, 0);">SetSecurityDescriptorDacl</a></span>, <span class="code inline-code"><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/securitybaseapi/nf-securitybaseapi-initializesecuritydescriptor" style="color:rgb(255, 100, 0);">InitializeSecurityDescriptor</a></span>,
            <span class="code inline-code"><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/sddl/nf-sddl-convertstringsecuritydescriptortosecuritydescriptora" style="color:rgb(255, 100, 0);">ConvertStringSecurityDescriptorToSecurityDescriptorA</a></span>, and <span class="code inline-code"><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-lookupaccountsida" style="color:rgb(255, 100, 0);">LookupAccountSidA</a></span> to
            apply the SDDL <span class="code inline-code" style="color: rgba(0,247,254,1);">S:(ML;;NW;;;LW)</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            In either case, this application has a gap between starting the driver's service and actually getting the single handle to that driver. This
            timing gap is what we'll exploit by rapidly making attempts at claiming the driver's handle in order to hope that our 'malicious' user-mode application
            is able to complete a request between the time it takes for the official service to create the driver server and send its own request.

        <p>
            This proof-of-concept allows the process to get a handle to the repackaged NetFilterSDK driver installed by the third party vendor, from there - an attacker can
            intercept almost any networking traffic on the system but in the PoC script just calls the IOCTL <span class="code inline-code" style="color: rgba(0,247,254,1);">0x12C800</span> to allocate
            and map some kernel-mode memory into the calling process' address space.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            There seems to be a lack of awareness about how device interaction could be limited throughout this application, ranging from the vendor failing to use <span class="code inline-code">seclevel</span>
            to the fact that the <span class="code inline-code">seclevel</span> key probably wouldn't have changed much as the security descriptors are applied <i>after</i> the
            device is setup, a symbolic link is applied, and an IRP dispatch handler is assigned.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I first discovered this vulnerability, I was unaware that the vendor had repackaged the NetFilterSDK binary and so I emailed them a couple of times a few months ago
            to no reply.
            After finding out that the driver was from NetFilterSDK I reached out to the owner of NetFilterSDK who confirmed that the behaviour was expected and that the third-party could
            patch the issue by using the aforementioned registry key to limit access (again, something that seems unlikely due to the order of applying the security policy).
        </p>
        <p>
            No patch is currently available for this as the third-party didn't acknowledge any of my emails. Additionally, this vendor seems to be a primarily B2B company that lists
            the likes of Cisco, Google, Oracle, Symantec, and Siemens as its customers and so it seems unlikely that an individual subscriber such as myself will get a response from their support team any time soon.

        <h3>Tracking a Certificate</h3>
        <p>
            After attempting to make contact with the distributors of this driver, I found that the service binary is signed under their company name.
            However, the driver -- in addition to being <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/test/hlk/">WHQL</a>-certified --
            is signed under the name of a Russian fuel company that has a registered address in Lipetsk (Russia) but no other connection to the vendor. I'm not
            sure if the driver was signed with a leaked certificate.
        </br></br>
            The vendor has been registered on <a href="https://www.rik.ee/">Estonia's company register</a> since 2020 with an address in Kyiv (Ukraine), but
            their website's WHOIS history (until it was hidden after 2021) claimed an address in Lipetsk (Russia) was in use, and the website's servers were
            also based in Lipetsk (mail and ancillary servers are still based there), possibly suggesting that a leaked certificate is less likely than developer(s) sharing a certificate between projects.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Given the possible locations of the vendor company or NetFilterSDK (which is definitely based in Russia), it's worth reminding anyone reading this that <span style="color:rgb(255, 230, 10);">there are a number
            of financial and non-financial ways to support Ukraine</span> as they repel Russia's invasion and accompanying
            <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/news/situation-ukraine-icc-judges-issue-arrest-warrants-against-vladimir-vladimirovich-putin-and">war crimes</a> - hence the <em>clickable</em> banner at the bottom of this page
            if you'd like to learn more.
        </p>
        <p>
            And finally, the email address associated with the vendor's company registration, domain, and the user-mode service's signature (but not mentioned on the
            vendor's website) is a personal one that has been listed on <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">HaveIBeenPwned</a> as being exposed
            in over 20 breaches, some as late as last year.
        </p>
        <p>
            Given that a chunk of fortune 500 companies seem to be using this person's driver,
            it seems incredibly risky to be using a personal email in signing certificates (and probably other aspects) when that address
            is at a high risk of <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Credential_stuffing">credential stuffing</a> attacks.
